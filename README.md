# Python-For-Finance

This project was created to learn how to use Python for financial analysis.


The following libraries are used:

matplotlib <br />
yfinance <br />
numpy <br />
statsmodels <br />
pandas <br />
pandas-datareader <br />

Here, I have learned about returns, moving windows, Ordinary Least-Squares Regression (OLS), volatility, backtesting with python and creating a basic moving average strategy.
